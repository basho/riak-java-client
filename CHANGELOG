1.0.3
-------------
This is a patch release that fixes a few minor issues. The one 
non-trivial change is the fixing of where the client would attempt to 
convert Riak Objects to JSON (b21fcfc).

1.0
-------------

This version adds 2 new APIs to the riak-java-client whilst
maintaining (for now) backwards compatibility with the 0.14
releases. If you are using the legacy HTTP or PB RiakClient API your
code should still work. Please consider migrating to the new API, the
old API will be deprecated in the next release, and removed the
release after that.

This version replaces the EOL Apache HTTP Client 3x dependancy with
Apache HTTP Client 4.1.1.

Please view the README and this blog post[1] for full details.

There is a new API built around the RawClient interface, a transport
agnostic abstraction. There are two implementation at present that
adapt the legacy clients to the new API. There is some small
performance cost in this, since types must be converted between the
new common API and the older transport specific API, but it is small
(and temporary.)

There is also a second, higher level API, based around the IRiakClient
and Bucket interfaces. This API is a fluent builder based API that
provides abstractions and interfaces for simplifiying aspects of
working with a distributed, fault tolerant database. Of most interest
is a primative ORM (using the excellent Jackson JSON library) and an
interface for encoding conflict resolution strategies.

0.14.1
-------------

This version fixes a few bugs with the protocol buffers client (including one
major crasher with setClientId).  It fixes a bug setting max connections per
host which limited the http client to 2 concurrent connections.  It fixes a
few encapsulation/thread safety issues. Some API elements have been deprecated
(direct access to RiakObject(s) links and user meta collections, mutation of
RiakLink) in preparation for removal in the next release.  Unit and integration
test coverage has been increased to ~70% in preparation for a refactor.  Java 5
is now supported.

**Changes**:

d8824e5 Add test to show byte[] value safely encapsulated in RiakObject
0e7d255 Add tests to show RiakObjects internal collections are thread safe

0.14.0
-------------

This version adds support for the riak protocol buffers interface.

0.11
-------------

This version no longer performs binary to String conversions automatically. All
bucket data is surfaced as byte arrays. Clients will need to either perform
their own string conversions or use the getBodyAsString() method added to the
com.basho.riak.client.response.HttpResponse interface.

0.10-SNAPSHOT
-------------

This version breaks compatibility with Riak releases prior to the pre-0.10
tag. Specifically, it no longer parses link walking results in prior releases.

**Changes**:

* Expect CRLF in multipart (link walking) results
  (http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/changeset/df553e35cc92/)
* RiakClient.getClientId() returns the raw client ID byte[4] rather than String
  to avoid charset encoding issues

0.9.1
-------------

First official release of riak-client.
