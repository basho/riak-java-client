1.0.6
-------------
This is a bugfix and feature relese

Worth special mention:

af12b6c - The default JSONConverter now supports multiple values via a @RiakIndex annotated Set<> (Integer or String). Note this also brings serialization/deserialization in line with our other annotaded fields in that these values will not be present in the resulting JSON. To override this behavior the Jackson @JsonProperty annotation can be supplied

9bd8e60 - You can now perform a store operation without the implicit fetch performed by the StoreObject.execute() method using the new StoreObject.withoutFetch() method. Also added a new @RiakVClock annotation to support this using your own POJOs.

1.0.4
-------------
This is a patch release that adds new features and fixes a few minor issues.
New features include support of the Riak /stats command through the IRiakClient
interface (when using HTTP - stats via PB is not supported by Riak), a shutdown()
method in the IRiakClient Interface that cleanly shuts down running threads, and
a new lazyLoadProperties() method for both FetchBucket and WriteBucket that
will eliminate a request to Riak for bucket properties if they're not needed.

1.0.2
-------------
This is a patch release that fixes a couple of minor bugs.

**Changes**
cf6db11 Correctly split content-type and charset for PB interface bz1288
85b94e7 This change fixes a bug in the Java client where all
        commit hooks are added to the pre-commit list; anything incoming in
        the post-commit list goes to the pre-commit hook list instead
2ddd975 Add connection timout to pb socket creation bz1275
855493c Fix incorrect encoding of reduce_phase_only_1 arg on fetch index bz1262
0c44b01 Fix incorrect default riak PB port  bz1285

1.0.1
-------------
This relase fixes 1 critical and 1 major bug in riak-java-client.  The
first is an error in the idle connection reaper that leads to an
infinite loop, the second a bug with the PB client factory which did
not start the idle connection thread before using the pool.

**Changes**

27fa0adfe4 Move connection age check inside connection timeout loop
           [bz://1251]
bf0efe0383 Fix factories/tests that did not start up the pool before
           using [bz://1252]
c85e98b263 RiakObjects created from link-walking now URLDecode their
           keys

1.0
-------------

This version adds 2 new APIs to the riak-java-client whilst
maintaining (for now) backwards compatibility with the 0.14
releases. If you are using the legacy HTTP or PB RiakClient API your
code should still work. Please consider migrating to the new API, the
old API will be deprecated in the next release, and removed the
release after that.

This version replaces the EOL Apache HTTP Client 3x dependancy with
Apache HTTP Client 4.1.1.

Please view the README and this blog post[1] for full details.

There is a new API built around the RawClient interface, a transport
agnostic abstraction. There are two implementation at present that
adapt the legacy clients to the new API. There is some small
performance cost in this, since types must be converted between the
new common API and the older transport specific API, but it is small
(and temporary.)

There is also a second, higher level API, based around the IRiakClient
and Bucket interfaces. This API is a fluent builder based API that
provides abstractions and interfaces for simplifiying aspects of
working with a distributed, fault tolerant database. Of most interest
is a primative ORM (using the excellent Jackson JSON library) and an
interface for encoding conflict resolution strategies.

0.14.1
-------------

This version fixes a few bugs with the protocol buffers client (including one
major crasher with setClientId).  It fixes a bug setting max connections per
host which limited the http client to 2 concurrent connections.  It fixes a
few encapsulation/thread safety issues. Some API elements have been deprecated
(direct access to RiakObject(s) links and user meta collections, mutation of
RiakLink) in preparation for removal in the next release.  Unit and integration
test coverage has been increased to ~70% in preparation for a refactor.  Java 5
is now supported.

**Changes**:

d8824e5 Add test to show byte[] value safely encapsulated in RiakObject
0e7d255 Add tests to show RiakObjects internal collections are thread safe
568cab8 Remove calls to deprecated methods from tests

0.14.0
-------------

This version adds support for the riak protocol buffers interface.

0.11
-------------

This version no longer performs binary to String conversions automatically. All
bucket data is surfaced as byte arrays. Clients will need to either perform
their own string conversions or use the getBodyAsString() method added to the
com.basho.riak.client.response.HttpResponse interface.

0.10-SNAPSHOT
-------------

This version breaks compatibility with Riak releases prior to the pre-0.10
tag. Specifically, it no longer parses link walking results in prior releases.

**Changes**:

* Expect CRLF in multipart (link walking) results
  (http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/changeset/df553e35cc92/)
* RiakClient.getClientId() returns the raw client ID byte[4] rather than String
  to avoid charset encoding issues

0.9.1
-------------

First official release of riak-client.
