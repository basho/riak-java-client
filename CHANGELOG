1.4.2
-----
This is a minor bugfix/maint release.

16c2255 Brian Roach Merge branch 'domain-bucket-tombstones' into 1.4.2



1.4.1
-----
This is only a patch for a protocol buffers library issue. There are no
changes to the client code.

Google released Protocol Buffers 2.5.0 in Feb/2013. Unfortunately there
are breaking changes that make protocol buffers generated by 2.4.1 
incompatable. Users using 2.5.0 in their own code therefore run into problems.

We have made the decision to shade 2.4.1 and our protocol buffers, including them
inside the .jar file.
We will be moving to v2.5.0 in the client v2.0

95380ea Dave Rusek Shade and rewrite packaging for com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java and com.basho.riak.protobuf:riak-pb to compensate for the fact that some users may have protobuf 2.5.0 in their classpath and that riak-pb is compiled wi

1.4.0
-----
This is a large feature release

The 1.4.0 client release goes with Riak 1.4. If you are using an older version
of Riak, please use the 1.1.2 client

With Riak 1.4 we've reached feature parity between  protocol buffers and HTTP.
The client will now allow any operation over PB where in the past some things required 
HTTP. 

One new Riak 1.4 feature in particular stands out; we now have counters. These are 
accessed/incremented through the new CounterObject which Bucket.counter() returns. 
For more details see the Javadoc.

1.0.6
-------------
This is a bugfix and feature relese

Worth special mention:

af12b6c - The default JSONConverter now supports multiple values via a @RiakIndex annotated Set<> (Integer or String). Note this also brings serialization/deserialization in line with our other annotaded fields in that these values will not be present in the resulting JSON. To override this behavior the Jackson @JsonProperty annotation can be supplied

9bd8e60 - You can now perform a store operation without the implicit fetch performed by the StoreObject.execute() method using the new StoreObject.withoutFetch() method. Also added a new @RiakVClock annotation to support this using your own POJOs.

1.0.4
-------------
This is a patch release that adds new features and fixes a few minor issues.
New features include support of the Riak /stats command through the IRiakClient
interface (when using HTTP - stats via PB is not supported by Riak), a shutdown()
method in the IRiakClient Interface that cleanly shuts down running threads, and
a new lazyLoadProperties() method for both FetchBucket and WriteBucket that
will eliminate a request to Riak for bucket properties if they're not needed.

convert Riak Objects to JSON (b21fcfc).

1.0.1
-------------
This relase fixes 1 critical and 1 major bug in riak-java-client.  The
first is an error in the idle connection reaper that leads to an
infinite loop, the second a bug with the PB client factory which did
not start the idle connection thread before using the pool.

1.0
-------------

This version adds 2 new APIs to the riak-java-client whilst
maintaining (for now) backwards compatibility with the 0.14
releases. If you are using the legacy HTTP or PB RiakClient API your
code should still work. Please consider migrating to the new API, the
old API will be deprecated in the next release, and removed the
release after that.

This version replaces the EOL Apache HTTP Client 3x dependancy with
Apache HTTP Client 4.1.1.

Please view the README and this blog post[1] for full details.

There is a new API built around the RawClient interface, a transport
agnostic abstraction. There are two implementation at present that
adapt the legacy clients to the new API. There is some small
performance cost in this, since types must be converted between the
new common API and the older transport specific API, but it is small
(and temporary.)

There is also a second, higher level API, based around the IRiakClient
and Bucket interfaces. This API is a fluent builder based API that
provides abstractions and interfaces for simplifiying aspects of
working with a distributed, fault tolerant database. Of most interest
is a primative ORM (using the excellent Jackson JSON library) and an
interface for encoding conflict resolution strategies.

0.14.1
-------------

This version fixes a few bugs with the protocol buffers client (including one
major crasher with setClientId).  It fixes a bug setting max connections per
host which limited the http client to 2 concurrent connections.  It fixes a
few encapsulation/thread safety issues. Some API elements have been deprecated
(direct access to RiakObject(s) links and user meta collections, mutation of
RiakLink) in preparation for removal in the next release.  Unit and integration
test coverage has been increased to ~70% in preparation for a refactor.  Java 5
is now supported.

**Changes**:

d8824e5 Add test to show byte[] value safely encapsulated in RiakObject
0e7d255 Add tests to show RiakObjects internal collections are thread safe

0.14.0
-------------

This version adds support for the riak protocol buffers interface.

0.11
-------------

This version no longer performs binary to String conversions automatically. All
bucket data is surfaced as byte arrays. Clients will need to either perform
their own string conversions or use the getBodyAsString() method added to the
com.basho.riak.client.response.HttpResponse interface.

0.10-SNAPSHOT
-------------

This version breaks compatibility with Riak releases prior to the pre-0.10
tag. Specifically, it no longer parses link walking results in prior releases.

**Changes**:

* Expect CRLF in multipart (link walking) results
  (http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/changeset/df553e35cc92/)
* RiakClient.getClientId() returns the raw client ID byte[4] rather than String
  to avoid charset encoding issues

0.9.1
-------------

First official release of riak-client.
