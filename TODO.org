* TODO Configure a RawClient from RiakFactory (config object, map?)
Include things like TCP_NODELAY etc
* TODO Push retrier down the stack to Raw level
* TODO Conversion needs more thought, especially around the key
* TODO Have store/fetch/delete Object operations use the pass through non converter if the type they are working with is IRiakObject
* TODO Have key as a parameter to convert?
* TODO remove vclock as param to convert?
* TODO reimplement JSONConverter as less of an example and more for production
* TODO key discovery from domain objects needs to be a strategy
* TODO moar unit tests
* TODO Add a DomainBucket.store(String key, T o) method
* TODO per op. cap on RiakBucket
* TODO Retrier, Mutator, Conflict resolver on RiakBucket
* TODO some sort of registry/lookup based on type/content type for Converters
* TODO Code audit for safety/oddness
EG Builders for use from single thread so remove sync from builder collections
* TODO Look at client id in a more thorough and logical way
What does it mean when a client is shared accross threads? Really an
operation is done by a client? or the connection has an ID? And we
match the connection to the client? Or we encourage lots of clients
and drop this one client per application thing?
* TODO consider a type for value + content-type since they are inextricably linked in every way
* TODO XML converter
* TODO consider modeling RiakOperation as Callable and RiakClient as executor
* TODO make default resolver a strategy added on client or bucket
* TODO make default mutator a strategy
* TODO RawClient - anything missing (Stream in, Stream out)
* TODO A PUMP (a super fast way to pump data into Riak)
* TODO Move pbc stuff into client.pbc
** TODO deprecate old pbc stuff in favour of new stuff
* TODO Class whittle down
* TODO RiakObject creation factory methods on RiakDomain Bucket
* TODO per op CAP quroa on RiakDomain bucket
* TODO per op CAP quora params on domain buckets
* TODO Links 
** TODO Links should return
- Siblings
- Domain objects
** TODO Mapping links
*** TODO What does this mean?
If you create a domain class you can annotate an field on it to
denote a link walk spec that will lead to the object(s) to populate
that field. (Transparent proxy? (only for collections right?))
** TODO Mapping user meta? (IE User Meta in domain object conversion)
** TODO proto client connection pool
* TODO periodic failing ITest PB Bucket on sibling test
* TODO Load balancing retrier
Cluster aware (uses stats call to learn about ring, or configured with
multlple hosts?)
* TODO Bucket properties
** TODO Rest interface is capable of more than the REST client abstraction exposes
expose all properties
** TODO PB interface for bucket props
* TODO streaming
** TODO Stream in
** TODO stream out
** TODO stream m/r
