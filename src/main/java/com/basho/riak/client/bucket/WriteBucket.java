 * A {@link RiakOperation} for creating/updating a {@link Bucket}.

 * This class is a fluid builder for creating a {@link RiakOperation} that sets
 * bucket properties on a bucket in Riak. It delegates to a
 * {@link BucketPropertiesBuilder} then uses its {@link RawClient} and
 * {@link Retrier} to set the bucket properties in Riak.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: all the parameters on the builder are optional. If omitted then the
 * Riak defaults will be used. Also, very few of these properties are supported
 * by both underlying APIs at present. They are here for completeness sake.
 * Changes are underway to support all the properties. Check the docs for the
 * individual parameters to see what is supported.
