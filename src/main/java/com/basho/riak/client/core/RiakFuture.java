/**
 * The result of an asynchronous Riak operation.
 * <p>
 * All Riak operations are asynchronous. It means when you execute an operation on
 * the cluster it will return immediately with no guarantee that the requested
 * operation has been completed at the end of the call. Instead, you will be returned
 * a {@code RiakFuture} instance which gives you the information about the result
 * or status of the operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@code RiakFuture} is either uncompleted or completed. When an operation begins, a new future
 * object is created. The new future is uncompleted initially - it is neither
 * succeeded, failed, nor canceled because the operation is not finished yet.
 * If the operation is finished either successfully, with failure, or by cancellation,
 * the future is marked as completed with more specific information, such as the
 * cause of the failure. Please note that even failure and cancellation belong to the completed state.
