/**
 * Command used to delete multiple values from Riak.
 * <p>
 * Riak itself does not support pipelining of requests. MultiDelete addresses this issue by using a thread to
 * parallelize and manage a set of async delete operations for a given set of keys.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The result of executing this command is a {@code List} of {@link RiakFuture} objects, each one representing a single
 * delete operation. The returned {@code RiakFuture} that contains that list completes
 * when all the DeleteValue operations contained have finished.
 * <p/>
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * {@code
 * MultiDelete multiDelete = ...;
 * MultiDelete.Response response = client.execute(multiDelete);
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The maximum number of concurrent requests defaults to 10. This can be changed
 * when constructing the operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Be aware that because requests are being parallelized performance is also
 * dependent on the client's underlying connection pool. If there are no connections
 * available performance will suffer initially as connections will need to be established
 * or worse they could time out.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Be aware that for responsiveness to the caller thread, the requests are run on a Daemon worker thread.
 * Shutting down the client JVM before the future is complete will result in unexpected behavior,
 * and only a subset objects may have been deleted.
